Configuration
=============

You have access to 5 configuration keys:

* PAGE_SIZE: the number of items in a page (default is 30)
* MAX_PAGE_SIZE: the maximum page size. If you specify a page size greater than this value you will receive a 400 Bad Request response.
* MAX_INCLUDE_DEPTH: the maximum length of an include through schema relationships
* ALLOW_DISABLE_PAGINATION: if you want to disallow to disable pagination you can set this configuration key to False
* CATCH_EXCEPTIONS: if you want fastapi_jsonapi to catch all exceptions and return them as JsonApiException (default is True)
