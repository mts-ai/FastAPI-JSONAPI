Pagination
==========

.. currentmodule:: fastapi_jsonapi

When you use the default implementation of the get method on a ResourceList
your results will be paginated by default.
Default pagination size is 30 but you can manage it from querystring parameter named "page".

.. note::

    Examples are not URL encoded for a better readability

Size
----

You can control page size like this:

.. sourcecode:: http

    GET /users?page[size]=10 HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Number
------

You can control page number like this:

.. sourcecode:: http

    GET /users?page[number]=2 HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Size + Number
-------------

Of course, you can control both like this:

.. sourcecode:: http

    GET /users?page[size]=10&page[number]=2 HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.api+json

Disable pagination
------------------

You can disable pagination by setting size to 0

.. sourcecode:: http

    GET /users?page[size]=0 HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/vnd.api+json
